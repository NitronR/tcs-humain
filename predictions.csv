"xxbos xxmaj is there a language or design pattern that allows the * removal * of object behavior or properties in a class hierarchy ? < p > a well - know xxunk of traditional class xxunk is that they are bad when it comes to model the real world . xxmaj as an example , trying to represent animals species with classes . xxmaj there are actually several problems when doing that , but one that i never saw a solution to is when a sub - class "" xxunk "" a behavior or properties that was defined in a super - class , like a xxunk not being able to fly ( there are probably better examples , but that 's the first one that comes to my mind , having seen "" xxmaj xxunk 2 "" recently ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj on the one hand , you do n't want to define for every property and behavior some flag that specifies if it is at all present , and check it every time before accessing that behavior or property . xxmaj you would just like to say that xxunk can fly , simply and clearly , in the xxmaj xxunk class . xxmaj but then it would be nice if one could define "" exceptions "" xxunk , without having to use some horrible hacks everywhere . xxmaj this often happens when a system has been productive for a while . xxmaj you suddenly find an "" exception "" that does n't fit in the original design at all , and you do n't want to change a large portion of your code to accommodate it . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so , is there some language or design patterns that can cleanly handle this problem , without requiring major changes to the "" super - class "" , and all the code that uses it ? xxmaj even if a solution only handle a specific case , several solutions might together form a complete strategy . < / p > 
 
  < p>[edit ] xxmaj forgot about the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj substitution xxmaj principle . xxmaj that is why you ca n't do it . xxmaj assuming you define "" xxunk / interfaces "" for all major "" feature groups "" , you can xxunk implement xxunk in different branches of the hierarchy , like the xxmaj xxunk trait could be implemented by xxmaj xxunk , and some special kind of xxunk and xxunk . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so my question could amount to "" xxmaj how could i un - implement a trait ? "" xxmaj if your super - class is a xxmaj java xxmaj serializable , you have to be one too , even if there is no way for you to serialize your state , for example if you contained a "" xxmaj socket "" . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so one way to do it is to always define all your xxunk in pair from the start : xxmaj xxunk and xxunk ( which would throw xxunk , if not checked against ) . xxmaj the xxmaj not - trait would not define any new interface , and could be simply checked for . xxmaj sounds like a "" cheap "" solution , in particular if used from the start . < / p >

  } 
 
  return xxunk ( ) ; 
  } 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the problem here of course is that the tostring method still uses the whole instance hashmap i.e. < code > xxunk ( ) ; < / code > instead of < code > xxunk result < / code > and so , on a search of < xxunk "" < / code > all results are returned i.e. "" xxmaj adam , xxmaj bob and xxmaj carl "" < / p > 
 
  < p><strong > xxmaj the xxup full answer : < / strong > 
  xxmaj the problem has now been resolved but only partly due to the answer given so i will mark it as the best answer but give full details below . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj not only should i include the tostring i also needed to manipulate the < code > xxunk < / code > , and because the query was based over a < code > xxunk < / code > i was able to cast the < code > xxunk < / code > back to a < code > xxunk < / code>. xxmaj in doing this i was then able to manipulate the < code > xxunk < / code > using it 's own instance methods . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj should i set my laptop to sleep / standby or hibernate when the battery is nearly dead ? < h3 > i know the question seems very simple at a first glance , but please hear me out before responding . i did my own research , and want to hear your thoughts / opinions . xxmaj if you do n't care , and just want to see what i 'm asking , see the points at the end of my post . < / h3 > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the primary reason for me asking this question here is to raise xxunk - we all believe that the second our laptop power is in xxunk , we must hibernate the system ... xxmaj why ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj to start , i am assuming that xxunk is basically dumping the system xxup ram and process states to the hard - drive , and shutting the computer down ( < a href=""http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / advanced%5fconfiguration%5fand%5fpower%5finterface # xxunk "" xxunk < / a > ) . xxmaj resuming would simply load the xxup ram back from the hard drive - a somewhat time consuming process < em > when compared to standby < / em>. < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj standby is simply putting the system in a low - power state , providing < em > just enough < / em > power to keep the xxup ram from erasing itself ( < a href=""http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / advanced%5fconfiguration%5fand%5fpower%5finterface # xxunk "" xxunk < / a > ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj now , according to < a href=""http : / / xxunk / xxunk / xxunk "" xxunk websites < / a > , standby mode in < a href=""http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / advanced%5fconfiguration%5fand%5fpower%5finterface # xxunk "" rel=""nofollow"">the xxup s3 state < / a > consumes next to no power . xxmaj even if the consumption was at "" worst "" ( xxup xxunk according to the linked website - which was for a desktop ) in standby mode , this is nothing compared to my laptop 's xxup xxunk usage on idle ( this figure was found by using < a href=""http : / / xxunk / xxunk "" xxunk < / a > ) . xxmaj from these figures , it can be xxunk that my battery will last < em > roughly < / em > 17 times as long in this state . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj now , assuming that you have a battery that xxunk about two hours , and you set the critical battery level to 3 % , you would have 3.6 minutes left on normal consumption , or roughly 1 hour on standby . xxmaj in most cases , you would have already saved your work if the battery level reached this critical level , regardless . i do n't believe that the consumption of a laptop in xxup s3 mode is even near xxup xxunk , the reason for this being my own test . < / p > 
 
  < p > i have done a test myself , with two laptops of mine ( a xxunk battery < a href=""http : / / xxunk / xxunk / wc / xxunk = xxunk = xxunk = xxunk = xxunk = xxunk "" xxunk < / a > , and a xxunk battery < a href=""http : / / xxunk / content / topics / xxunk / xxunk = xxunk = xxunk "" xxunk < / a > ) . xxmaj in both , i ran them until the battery was at 3 % and automatically entered standby . < / p > 
 
  < p > i then turned on the machines again , rebooted them ( just to drain the battery a little more ) , and manually placed them into standby . xxmaj after leaving them overnight , without even plugging them in again , i turned them back on ( xxunk hours later ) , to find that all of my data was still there ( long enough for me to grab my power cable and save what was on the screen ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj both of these laptops are just over a year old , which is n't too old ... xxmaj but the xxmaj xxunk battery is n't very good , and xxunk usually around 1.5 hours . < / p > 
 
  < ul > 
  < li > xxmaj now , am i safe in assuming that i can completely disable the hibernate mode on my laptop , and just use the standby mode ? < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj has anyone done any tests like this in the past ? < / li >

  < p > xxmaj what is still a little ugly looking is when / where the ball is removed after making collision with a target . xxmaj my , perhaps , awkward conditional chain of coordinate calculations largely works from an effectiveness xxup xxunk , but the ball always seems to be removed several pixels ( ? ) prior to the actual collision being measures - even accounting for bounding boxes as opposed to actual shapes . i also attempted to turn the ball into a tween just before it was removed to make it fade away in a pretty xxunk , but that never seemed to work . xxmaj and i never even tried to tackle turning the arc - xxunk "" xxunk "" under each target into actual collision objects that the ball could roll along if the aim was off . xxmaj that was just put into the "" too hard "" basket . xxmaj below is my code for the collision measuring and the xxunk , just in case anyone has any keen insights to add . xxmaj otherwise , i 'm relatively happy with the end result . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj why are my units "" compiled with a different version "" of my own files ? < p > xxmaj i'm building a program that uses plugins . xxmaj unfortunately , the plugin framework 's dynamic linking forces the xxup rtl and xxup vcl out of my project xxup exe and into the xxup xxunk versions , and they do n't have debug info enabled . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so i built a testing framework that links to my plugins statically so i can actually see what i 'm doing while tracing through the code . xxmaj but now , every time i try to recompile , i get an error : "" unit xxunk was compiled with a different version of xxunk . xxunk "" < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj i've seen this error before , but only when i 've been changing things i probably should n't have been , like the xxup rtl or xxup vcl libraries . i do n't understand why it 's doing that with my own code . xxmaj the xxunk and xxunk units are both units i wrote myself . xxunk is a global singleton variable , whose class definition i have n't changed in weeks . xxmaj any change that triggers a recompile causes this error , even if i have n't touched anything in either of the units . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj doing a full build ( xxup shift - xxup xxunk ) causes it to compile correctly . xxmaj but if i then press < strong > xxup space < / strong > in a unit ( < em > any < / em > unit ) and hit xxup xxunk , i get the error again . xxmaj what 's going on and how do i stop it ? xxmaj this does n't happen in the main app , only the testing framework . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxup edit : i have the source to all of my units . xxmaj deleting xxunk and similar files does n't help . xxmaj copying the entire project to a different computer , deleting all xxunk , and building there does n't help . xxmaj there 's an objective , reproducible conflict between the layout of my program and the compiler , and i want to be rid of it . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the source can be found at < a href=""http : / / xxunk / downloads / xxmaj xxunk : / / xxunk / downloads / xxmaj xxunk < / a > if anyone wants to test it . xxmaj it requires xxmaj delphi 2009 with the xxup xxunk already installed ; the installer package will take care of the rest . xxmaj maybe having the source code available will help someone track this down . i certainly hope so , because wherever the issue is , it 's beyond me . xxmaj the problem can be found in xxunk and also in xxunk in xxunk . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj what happens when several xxmaj java servlet apps running on the same port ? < p > xxmaj something strange happened to my servlets and i think i 've figured out why , yet i 'm more confused . i used xxmaj xxunk to develop a xxmaj paypal xxup xxunk ( xxmaj instant xxmaj payment xxmaj notification ) message servlet , it listens on port 8080 by default for xxmaj paypal xxup xxunk messages . i used some sample xxmaj java code from it 's web site , but when it ran , only about 1 in 10 messages came through , and they looked correct , but why 1 in 10 ? xxmaj not 100 % or none ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so i asked some questions here and got some advices , one in particular points me to xxmaj google 's xxmaj app xxmaj engine , so i downloaded it and ran the demo xxunk while my xxup xxunk servlet is still running on xxmaj netbeans , the strange thing happened , after i entered "" appengine - java - xxunk \ bin \ xxunk appengine - java - xxunk \ demos \ xxunk \ war "" from the command prompt , i went to the following url on my browser "" http : / / localhost:8080 / "" , i thought i would see the xxmaj google demo xxunk page , xxup no , what i saw was another servlet i developed 2 years ago : "" xxmaj web xxmaj xxunk "" , online course registration app . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj how can that happen ? i never started it , and i have n't touch that project for years . i guess because it 's also listening on port 8080 , so now i understand why the xxup xxunk messages only came through 1 in 10 times , because another servlet was also listening on that port and could have got the messages intended for xxup xxunk , or some how those two servlets ' processes mixed up and therefore could n't respond to xxmaj paypal properly , and failed . xxmaj in order to verify some of my xxunk . < / p > 
 
  < p > i turn off xxmaj netbeans , and ran the xxmaj google xxunk again at the prompt , this time on my browser < a href=""http : / / localhost:8080 / "" rel=""nofollow"">http : / / localhost:8080 / < / a > points to the demo xxunk page . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj my xxmaj urls look like this : < / p >

  < p > xxmaj so now , my questions are : < / p > 
 
  < ol > 
  < li > xxmaj why the "" xxmaj web xxmaj xxunk "" servlet was auto started when i ran the xxmaj paypal servlet ? < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj if i change the xxup xxunk listening port to xxunk , would that mean i can run both of them on my xxup pc at the same time without affecting each other ? < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj but i still do n't understand , [ a ] and [ b ] look different , if a page for [ a ] is refreshed , it should show the xxmaj paypal content , and another page looking at [ b ] should show the xxmaj web xxmaj xxunk content , and that 's exactly what happens when i started xxmaj netbeans to run the xxmaj paypal servlet , both pages show their respective content correctly side by side without interfering with each other , how come the xxup xxunk messages could n't get through 100 % of the time ? < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj in xxmaj netbeans how to assign 8080 to servlet [ a ] and assign port xxunk to servlet [ b ] ? < / li >

  < p > xxmaj often , the service would not stop when i try to stop it from the xxmaj windows service management console . xxmaj if i debug it and add a breakpoint to the onstop ( ) method i can see that it is not because the xxunk is stuck on a number greater than 0 ( often much greater than 10 ! ) . xxmaj no tasks are running and it stays on that number forever ! < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj firstly , i do n't understand how that number could ever be greater than 10 , despite the < code > threadpool . xxunk < / code > should limit it to 10 ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj secondly , even if i did not set the maximum number of threads , i would expect the finally block of the xxunk 's to eventually bring the count back to 0 . xxmaj if the counter stays greater than 0 , it can be explained only with the finally block not executing , right ! ? xxmaj how that is possible ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj and lastly , would you suggest a differently way to limit the xxmaj poll to a number of possible concurrent running threads to a fixed number ( xxup .net 3.5 ) ? < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj how to let users see & play songs on xxmaj android to which they already have access ( e.g. , via xxmaj google xxmaj play ) ? < p > xxmaj i'm running into a roadblock integrating music into my xxmaj android app . xxmaj the goal is just to let users see & & play songs to which they already have access , via xxmaj google xxmaj play xxmaj music ( or any other player such as xxmaj winamp , xxmaj xxunk , xxunk , etc . ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so far , i 've tried a couple of approaches , but each has problems . < / p > 
 
  < p><strong > xxmaj approach # 1 : xxmaj use a xxunk query to get playlists & & songs from xxmaj google xxmaj play music , then play using mediaplayer < / strong > < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj first , get a cursor on the play lists : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > xxmaj string [ ] xxunk = { xxunk . xxmaj audio . xxmaj playlists . xxup name , 
  xxunk . xxmaj audio . xxunk } ; 
  xxmaj uri xxunk = xxmaj xxunk : / / xxunk / playlists "" ) ; 
  xxmaj cursor xxunk = xxunk , xxunk , null , null , null ) ; 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj then iterate to get the songs in each playlist , and read them like this : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > xxmaj string [ ] xxunk = { xxunk . xxmaj audio . xxmaj playlists . xxmaj members . xxup title , 
  xxunk . xxmaj audio . xxmaj playlists . xxunk } ; 
  xxmaj string xxunk = "" content : / / xxunk / playlists / "" + xxunk + "" / members "" ; 
  xxmaj uri xxunk = xxunk ) ; 
  xxmaj cursor xxunk = xxunk , xxunk , null , null , null ) ; 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj this works to get the playlists and songs , but then you ca n't actually play them ( even if you tell xxmaj google xxmaj play xxmaj music to "" xxmaj keep on device "" ) . xxmaj specifically , the following code does not play a given song found as above : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > mediaplayer = new mediaplayer ( ) ; 
  xxunk . xxup xxunk ) ; 
  try { 
  xxunk ) ; 
  xxunk ( ) ; 
  xxunk ( ) ; 
  } catch ( xxmaj exception e ) { } 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj in fact , i 've scanned the device , and have not been able to find the files anywhere ( even though i 've confirmed they are local by fully disabling the network -- on both xxmaj galaxy xxmaj nexus and xxmaj galaxy xxup s3 ) . < / p > 
 
  < p><strong > xxmaj approach # 2 : xxmaj invoke xxmaj google xxmaj play xxmaj music , or other player , using an xxmaj intent < / strong > < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj according to < a href=""http : / / stackoverflow.com / questions / xxunk / android - launching - music - player - using - xxunk post < / a > , you can simply invoke the player using xxmaj intents , like this : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > xxmaj intent intent = new xxmaj intent ( ) ; 
  xxunk ) ; 
  xxmaj file file = new xxunk ) ; 
  xxunk ) , "" audio / * "") ; 
  startactivity(intent ) ; 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but i do n't think this approach allows for any kind of control -- for example , passing a specific song to be played , or being notified when a song is done being played . xxmaj furthermore , xxunk points out that the music app and its xxmaj intents are not part of the xxmaj android xxup sdk 's public xxup api , and could change without warning . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the basic functionality i 'm trying to achieve exists in ios , thanks to tight integration with itunes . i would think that xxmaj google would want to achieve the same kind of integration , since it could mean selling a lot more music in the xxmaj play store . < / p > 
 
  < p><strong > xxmaj in xxmaj summary : < / strong > xxmaj is it possible to let users see & & play songs to which they already have access on xxmaj android ? xxmaj what 's the best way to do this with xxmaj google xxmaj play xxmaj music , or any other app ? xxmaj thanks . < / p >

  < p > xxmaj so there is coffeescript , which i 'm looking at with a fair amount of interest . xxmaj then there is xxup rjs , but then xxmaj rails 3 has pulled support for that and i do n't want to learn an outdated method . xxmaj then there is xxmaj go , which i 'm not sure has enough support yet and just do n't know enough about yet . xxmaj then of course all along here most of the time here there 's jquery . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but should i even use jquery ? xxmaj can i get around writing javascript entirely ? xxmaj would / could the xxunk attempt be xxunk ? i 'm not asking for a xxunk session or a xxunk session , so if you 're xxunk up like that please do n't post here . i 'm actually xxunk by javascript . xxmaj if only because all of the "" cool "" programmers are talking about functional languages now . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but i do n't want to waste my time . xxmaj and all i really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails / active - record to the javascript in a variety of ways . xxmaj and i need to know what i 'm doing with javascript . xxmaj in fact that 's mainly all i need to do . i need to be able to look at javascript , or coffeescript , or go , or whatever , and see it like i see ruby , which looks like an xxunk if it 's written right . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so my questions are these : 
  a. ) xxmaj it seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who do n't know what exactly it is they are doing . xxmaj what are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code , thinking xxunk ( xxup correctly ) about xxmaj javascript ? xxmaj also xxunk materials . xxmaj xxunk lacking . xxmaj there is not a single book out on xxmaj rails 3 + xxmaj javascript , which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006 's "" xxmaj ajax on xxmaj rails "" . xxmaj what resources do you know of other than "" lots of time "" ? 
  b. ) xxup rjs , xxmaj coffeescript , etc v. xxmaj javascript + xxmaj jquery ( or alt . ) 
  xxmaj what are the weaknesses of using the ' higher - level ' xxunk languages and what are the benefits . xxmaj and most importantly for me , a rails user , < strong > what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now ? ? < / strong > xxup rjs xxunk like a great idea . xxmaj but it used prototype right ? xxmaj is there an "" xxup rjs "" which is xxmaj rails 3 ready ? < / p >

  < p > xxmaj again , the ' problem ' with my above approach is that i think there is a lot of possibly unnecessary copying of the data for the in - between steps . < / p >

  < p > xxmaj say your using the mongodb xxup php driver and you have a < code > mongodate < / code > object in a class var named < code > ts < / code > within a class that represents a single row in a collection in your database . xxmaj now you acces this var like : < xxunk < / code > but xxup php throws a fit ( xxup e_notice ) because < code > ts < / code > in this case is not defined as an object in itself because this particular row does not have a < code > ts < / code > field . xxmaj so you think this is xxup ok , this is desired behaviour , if it 's not set return null and i will take care of it myself outside of the interpreters own xxunk xxunk ( since you wrap this in a < code > date ( ) < / code > function that just returns < xxunk < / code > if the var is < code > null < / code > or a < code > none - object < / code > ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but now to fix that xxup e_notice as another developer really wants me to since having xxup any xxunk is xxunk and it makes the code slower to not do it according to the errors . xxmaj so i make a new function in the < xxunk < / code > class called < code > xxunk < / code > and i give it 3 lines , literally to do nothing but check if the < code > ts < / code > var is a < code > mongodate < / code > object and return it if it is ... < / p > 
 
  < p > xxup why ? xxmaj ca n't xxup php do this perfectly fine for me within its much faster interpreter than having to do it within the runtime of the app itself ? i mean every where i am having to add useless xxunk to my code , pretty much empty functions to detect variables that i actually just handle with xxunk own ability to return < code > null < / code > or checking their < code > instanceof < / code > when i really need to ( when it is vital to the operation and behaviour of the said function ) and do n't get me started on the < code > isset ( ) < / code > s i have added about 300 lines of < code > isset ( ) < / code > s , it 's getting out of hand . i have of course got to make this < code > xxunk < / code > functions because you ca n't do : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > class obj { 
  public $ ts = new mongodate ( ) ; 
  } 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > i would either have to store the < code > ts < / code > within the < xxunk < / code > ( which i am not too happy about either , i am using a lot of xxunk as it is ) or use a function to detect if it 's set ( which i do now ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > i mean i understand why i should fix : < / p > 
 
  < ul > 
  < li > xxmaj undefined vars < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj assigning properties of unset vars ( < code > null < / code > vars ) < / li > 
  < li > constant errors etc < / li > 
  < / ul > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but if you have tested your code and you know it is safe and will only work the way you desire what is the point in fixing all of the < code > undefined index < / code > or < code > none - object < / code > errors ? xxmaj is n't adding a bunch of < code > isset ( ) < / code > s and 2 lines functions to your code actually micro - optimisation ? < / p > 
 
  < p > i have noticed after making half my site xxup e_notice compliant that actually it uses more xxup cpu , memory and time now ... so really what 's the point of dealing with every xxup e_notice error and not just the ones that xxup are errors ? < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj reducing memory overhead in xxup iis setup with shared xxup asp.net applications < p > xxmaj i've got three core xxup asp.net applications that i need to run . i 'm setting up two xxmaj windows xxmaj server 2008 xxup r2 servers with mirrored xxup iis 7.5 configurations and then a load balancer to direct traffic and another server to be the state server . xxmaj that 's all setup and working ( not in production yet ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj we have about 120 clients ( and growing ) and my setup now is that each client gets their own virtual directory ( as a xxup .net application ) off the xxup iis root . xxmaj the virtual directory application points to a directory on disk where their own web.config lives to store things like connection strings and some core application parameters . xxmaj then off of each client 's application there 's a virtual directory application for each of the three core xxup asp.net apps . xxmaj so something like this : < / p > 
 
  < pre><code > / ( xxup iis root ) 
  / xxunk = > c : \ inetpub \ clients \ xxunk 
  / app1 = > c : \ inetpub \ applications \ app1 \ current

  / app1 = > c : \ inetpub \ applications \ app1 \ current 
  / app2 = > c : \ inetpub \ applications \ app2 \ current 
  / app3 = > c : \ inetpub \ applications \ app3 \ current 
  < / code > < / pre > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the ' current ' directory is a symlink to the current version being used . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj this setup has some advantages < / p > 
 
  < ul > 
  < li > xxmaj automatic xxunk of xxup .net session , application , and authentication info . xxmaj zero chance of any cross - application xxunk or security problems ( e.g. xxunk changes the xxup url to see xxunk ) . < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj automatic web.config inheritance so there 's no need to go searching on disk for each client 's config file . xxmaj the settings "" just work "" . < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj each client can be ( and is ) configured to have their own application pool so one client ca n't cause problems for anyone else with regards to performance . < / li > 
  < / ul > 
 
  < p > xxmaj disadvantages : < / p > 
 
  < ul > 
  < li > xxmaj there is significant memory overhead with having one app pool per client < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj each application instance ( e.g. / xxunk / app1 , / xxunk / app2 , / xxunk / app1 , ... ) is compiled separately by xxup asp.net even though there are only three "" real "" applications < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj there 's app pool xxunk time overhead . xxmaj if one client has n't accessed the server in a while , the first hit has to wait for their worker process to start . i 've xxunk this by running all the xxunk in 32 bit mode . < / li > 
  < / ul > 
 
  < p > xxmaj my biggest issue is the memory consumption . xxmaj if i use curl to loop over and hit each application at each client , every worker process is using about 100 xxup mb of xxup ram . xxmaj that means i 'd need 16 xxup gb of server xxup ram to safely operate . xxmaj that is nuts considering that the apps themselves really are n't that big or terribly complex . xxmaj memory xxunk for each worker process is roughly : xxmaj private bytes 70 xxup mb , xxmaj working xxmaj set 85 xxup mb , xxup ws xxmaj shared : 32 xxup mb . xxmaj memory is a concern since these are cloud servers where the cost is directly related to xxup ram usage . xxmaj even if it were n't the cost , it still seems nuts to allow memory to be xxunk like that . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj my first question is : is there anything i can do to configure xxup iis or xxup asp.net to not compile each application instance separately but to realise that the three apps are in fact the exact same code , thus hopefully reducing startup time and perhaps even memory usage ? xxmaj if i do clients * applications * two servers , that 's xxunk ' applications ' compiled on disk . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj second question is one of best practices . xxmaj is my setup xxunk ( for lack of a better word ) ? xxmaj is the xxup ram waste worth it for the sake of code simplicity and security ? xxmaj is there another way to achieve the benefits of web.config inheritance and session / application / forms auth without having separate applications in this way ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj thinking of the code changes needed to change the setup so there are only three applications and for those applications to become client - aware is rather xxunk and kind of xxunk . < / p > 
 
  < ol > 
  < li > xxmaj adding { client } to the root of each xxup mvc route ( one app is n't xxup mvc so that 'd be different ) < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj using { client } to search for and load configuration files stored elsewhere on disk . xxmaj perhaps in json format or something . < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj on each request , make sure the { client } has n't changed , and if it has , clear all session and application variables . xxmaj de - auth the user to prevent security problems . < / li >

  < p > xxmaj i'm not looking for anyone to make up my mind for me , but if anyone has faced similar issues before , it 'd be nice to hear about them . xxmaj or maybe there will be consensus that i am totally on the wrong track and need to change my code and setup . i think any kind of feedback on the issues would be useful , and certainly appreciated . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj is the xxup cocomo model a good argument when defending a programming language choice ? < p > xxmaj currently , i 'm following a course on embedded software development . xxmaj the lecturer has chosen < a href=""http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / xxmaj xxunk "" xxunk < / a > as an architecture language for model - driven software development . j itself is a very terse programming language and one of his main arguments for this language is its xxunk . xxmaj for instance , this is a xxmaj xxunk implementation in j : < / p >

  < p > xxmaj another argument is that through such a language and the reduced number of characters , you introduce less bugs and the time to fix bugs is reduced . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj since i have a strong software engineering background and through various books like xxmaj clean xxmaj code , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj programmer and others , i feel that these arguments are n't valid . i find that there is a strong movement towards descriptive names and code that reads like natural language ( alright , this might only be related to applications with lots of business logic and less math ) . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the question therefore is , can you really xxunk that usage of a terse programming language will result in less errors and that time to fix a bug is reduced ? xxmaj also , since the language is terse , the number of lines of code is reduced and you would get a better xxup cocomo rating . xxmaj but can this be applied in the first place or does the xxup cocomo model use the number of lines of code as a way to estimate a project 's overall size ( project size should be the same whether you implement it in a terse language or in an xxunk one , but again , maybe i did n't understand the xxup cocomo model correctly ) ? < / p >

  < p > xxmaj what i try to do is to cleanup that final list for < em > substrings < / em > also contained in phrases inside the terms list . xxmaj for example , looking at the above list snippet , there is the phrase < xxunk discovery ' < / strong > and therefore i would like to remove the single terms < xxunk ' < / strong > and < xxunk ' < / strong > , because they are also in the list and redundant in this context . i want to keep the phrases containing the single terms . i am also thinking about to remove all strings equal or less 3 characters . xxmaj but that is just a thought for now . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj for this cleanup process i would like to code a class using remove_if / xxunk ( using the new xxup c++ lambdas ) and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class . < / p > 
 
  < p > i am not really sure on how to solve this . xxmaj the problem is that i first would have to identify what strings to remove , by probably setting a flag as an delete marker . xxmaj that would mean i would have to pre - process that list . i would have to find the single terms and the phrases that contain one of those single terms . i think that is not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm . xxmaj using a suffix tree to identify substrings ? < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj another loop on the vector and maybe a copy of the same vector could to the clean up . i am looking for something most efficient in a time manner . < / p >

  xxmaj the way to go is to check the quality of the resulting weighted terms with other search result sets and see how i can improve the quality and find a way to boost the more relevant terms in conjunction with the original query term . xxmaj it might be not an easy task to do , i wish there would be some "" simple heuristics "" .

  < p > xxmaj the idea behind what i have is there exists a static buffer which is filled 
  with delta queue objects . xxmaj each delta queue object has pointers to the 
  previous / next delta queue object , a relative delay to the previous task and 
  some process information ( process xxup id and function pointer ) . xxmaj there are 3 
  global pointers , the ready pointer , sleep pointer and the available 
  pointer . xxmaj the ready pointer points to a list of tasks to be executed . xxmaj the 
  sleep pointer to a list of tasks which are ... well ... asleep and not ready 
  to execute . xxmaj the available pointer basically points to the end where there 
  is an available slot . xxmaj these pointers only move forward . xxmaj when one is pushed 
  up against another , that ' sub - queue ' is empty . xxmaj for example , when the ready 
  pointer equals the sleep pointer , there are no ready tasks . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj calculating monodromy < p > xxmaj i'm right now learning about xxmaj monodromy from self - studying xxmaj xxunk xxmaj miranda 's fantastic book "" xxmaj algebraic xxmaj curves and xxmaj riemann surfaces "" . xxmaj today , i read about monodromy , and the monodromy representation of a holomorphic map between compact xxmaj riemann surfaces . i understand that we start by having a holomorphic map $ f : x \ rightarrow xxup y$ , of degree d , where x and y are xxmaj riemann surfaces , and then we remove the branch points from y , and all the corresponding points in x mapping to them . xxmaj let $ xxup b= \ { xxunk .. xxunk \ } $ be the branch points , $ xxup xxunk \ { xxunk ... xxunk \ } $ the xxunk points . xxmaj so , fix a point $ q \ in v = y - xxup b$. xxmaj we have that there are d xxunk of q in $ u = x - xxup xxunk < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so for a specific branch point b , we choose some small open xxunk w of b so that $ xxup xxunk gives a disjoint union $ xxmaj xxunk of open xxunk of the points mapping to b. xxmaj take some path from our xxunk $ q$ to $ xxunk \ in xxup w$ , call this path $ \ xxunk xxmaj choosing some small loop $ \ beta$ with xxunk q , with xxunk number 1 around b , and then considering $ \ xxunk } \ circ \ beta \ xxunk , gives a loop on v , based at q around b. xxmaj we can now see that this loop only depends on $ \ beta$ , in some sense . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj say that the points that maps to b has multiplicity $ xxunk ... xxunk xxmaj then we have that , according to local normal form , there are local coordinates $ xxunk on the open xxunk from above , so that the map takes the form $ z = xxunk xxmaj now , we have that the loop around b , when we lift it up here , will simply yield a cyclic permutation of the xxunk in the xxunk . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj now , my question is mostly : 
  < strong > xxmaj how do i apply this xxunk ? < / strong > 
  xxmaj let us take an example ( from xxmaj miranda 's book ) : 
  "" xxmaj let $ f(z ) = xxunk / ( xxunk $ define a holomorphic map of degree 4 from $ xxup xxunk $ to itself . xxmaj show that there are three branch points , and that the three permutations in $ xxup xxunk $ are $ \ xxunk , $ \ xxunk and $ \ xxunk up to conjugacy . "" 
  i can find the branch points , and i see that the multiplicity of the two points mapping to it has multiplicity 2 , but i do n't get how to xxunk show that the above are the associated permutations . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj thread - safety of read - only memory access < p > xxmaj i've implemented the xxmaj xxunk - xxmaj xxunk gravity algorithm in c as follows : < / p > 
 
  < ol > 
  < li > xxmaj build a tree of clustered xxunk . < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj for each xxunk , traverse the tree and apply the xxunk forces from each applicable node . < / li > 
  < li > xxmaj update the xxunk xxunk and positions . < / li > 
  < / ol > 
 
  < p > xxmaj stage 2 is the most expensive stage , and so is implemented in parallel by xxunk the set of xxunk . xxmaj e.g. with 1000 xxunk and 2 threads , i have one thread processing the first 500 xxunk and the second thread processing the second 500 . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj in practice this works : it speeds the computation by about 30 % with two threads on a two - core machine , compared to the non - threaded version . xxmaj additionally , it yields the same numerical results as the original non - threaded version . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj my concern is that the two threads are accessing the same resource ( namely , the tree ) simultaneously . i have not added any xxunk to the thread workers , so it 's likely they will attempt to read from the same location at some point . xxmaj although access to the tree is strictly read - only i am not 100 % sure it 's safe . xxmaj it has worked when i 've tested it but i know this is no guarantee of xxunk ! < / p >

  < p>0 means no threading at all ; 1 and above means spawn that many worker threads and for the main thread to wait for them . i would not expect much of an xxunk for anything beyond 2 threads , since it 's entirely xxup cpu bound and that 's how many cores there are . xxmaj it 's interesting that an odd number of threads is slightly worse than an even number . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj looking at < code > sys < / code > it 's apparent that there 's a cost with making threads . xxmaj currently it 's making the threads for each frame ( so xxup xxunk thread xxunk ) . xxmaj this was easy to program ( during my 15 minutes on the train this morning ) . i 'll need to think a bit about how to reuse threads ... < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj is there a way to backup the windows recovery partition or recreate it on a sony xxunk laptop ? < p > xxmaj my friend got a xxmaj sony xxmaj xxunk laptop . xxmaj soon , i will install him xxmaj linux . xxmaj but i want to back up the xxmaj windows 7 's recovery partition that came pre - installed . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj but on laptop , normally , when we boot up , they ask to press xxmaj fx ( where x is a number i do n't know , since its not my laptop ) to launch the recovery partition . xxmaj if i use xxmaj xxunk to back up its recovery partition , how may i restore the functionality to press xxmaj fx to start the recovery partition , if i ever xxunk the whole drive , and rewrite the back up to the drive ? < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj how do i reduce over 1000 links programatically in a jump menu ? < p > xxmaj ok , so maybe my search syntax is wrong here , this could have very well been covered in stackoverflow but i 've been unable to find anything after hours of searching . xxmaj be xxunk , i am a novice developer when it comes to this type of stuff and would appreciate any guidance , help or pointers to accomplish the goal . i 'm open to suggestions of any type ! :) < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so , i have a site < a href=""http : / / xxunk "" rel=""nofollow"">http : / / xxunk < / a > < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj on this site we have a popular feature called a "" jump menu "" which allows a user to quickly navigate directly to the page which contains the anime series they would like to see an episode in . xxmaj essentially we have every series on the site ( over 1000 ) broken down in an a - z list . xxmaj when a user hovers over a letter , the menu will drop down and display all series that begin with that letter . a user can then go to the series they 'd like to view and click on it to go directly to the page . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the issue with this is xxup seo . xxmaj we are being xxunk due to the number of links on the page . xxmaj what we need to accomplish is the same ( or better ) functionality while reducing the links loaded in the page . xxmaj if we could come up with a way to create the menu and have the link itself not be served until its clicked on i believe that would resolve the issue . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj what is the best strategy for doing this ? i am no expert by any means , but i was thinking that putting all the links in mysql and then calling the link as its clicked would be ok , but a friend xxunk me that it would cause a performance hit . i have also reviewed material which indicates you can do the same thing using an array to store the links and then call them as they are needed using xxup php . i grasp the concept of doing that but could use a stub type example to get me started . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj the site is built on xxmaj wordpress with a completely custom template / theme . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj someone has commented that the topic was n't researched . xxmaj unfortunately i 've spent lots of time researching it , the problem is that i think i 'm using the wrong terminology to describe what i need to find . xxmaj if anyone would care to give me the terminology or a good place to xxunk further research ( even a few keywords ! ) i will be xxup more than happy to go do that . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj should i instantiate a collection or inherit from collection ? < p > xxmaj i've asked myself this question a number of times when creating classes , particularly those involving collections , but i 've never come up with a satisfactory answer . xxmaj it 's a xxup oop design question . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj for example , in a xxunk register program say i have a class of < code > bankaccount < / code>. xxunk contain data involving the xxmaj name of the account , the xxmaj type of account ( enum of xxmaj checking , xxmaj saving , ... ) , and other data , but most importantly is a collection of the < code > xxmaj adjustment < / code > s ( xxunk or xxunk ) in the account . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj here , i have two options for keeping a collection of the xxmaj adjustments : < / p > 
 
  < ol > 
  < li > xxmaj instantiate a collection and keep it as a member within the bankaccount class . xxmaj this is like saying "" bankaccount < em > has < / em > a collection of xxmaj adjustments . "" < / li >

  < p > i think both solutions are intuitive , and , of course , both offer some advantages and disadvantages . xxmaj for example , instantiating allows the class ( in languages that allow only a single base class ) to inherit from another class , while inheriting from collection makes it easy to control the xxmaj add , xxmaj remove , and other methods without having to write surrogate methods to ' wrap ' those . < / p >

  at the time of the call . xxmaj what would be the best way to refresh just 
  the frame containing the xxup html report ? xxmaj it appears making subsequent 
  calls to xxunk passing in the same xxmaj url each time would do the trick , 
  but it actually does n't seem to contain the additional content that 
  would 've been written since the last call . xxmaj it is also resetting the 
  vertical scroll bar 's position each time back to the top of the bar 
  which is something else i would like to prevent . < / p >

"xxbos xxmaj render target for each scene , for transitions < p > xxmaj i'm trying to come up with a general concept for transitions , without having to include any specific code inside the actual scene . xxmaj in all the samples i 've seen so far the scenes handle that stuff themselves . xxmaj like a fade in / out , where the scenes have to adjust their draw method , for the correct transparency . xxmaj but not only would this be annoying to have in every scene , with multiple kinds of transitions you 'd get xxunk code pretty fast . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so i 've been thinking . xxmaj the only way i could come up with to support this , and more complicated transitions , without handling it in the scene itself , are render targets for each scene . xxmaj the render target would be set from the scene manager before calling the draw method . xxmaj after draw the render target would get reset to the render target of the manager , and the scene 's texture would get drawn with information about the current transition . xxmaj without clearing the manager texture more scenes would follow , if more have to be drawn . xxmaj this way you could do pretty much anything ( transition wise ) , the scenes would be completely independent of each other , and you would n't need a single line of transition code in the actual scenes . ( xxmaj for reference , there are various transition types i 'd like to be able to do . xxmaj not only fades , but also shader effects , moving one scene in while the current one is "" pushed away "" , etc . , involving one or multiple scenes . ) < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj well , that 's my theory . xxmaj here comes my question : xxmaj does this sound like a viable plan ? xxmaj is this the way to go ? i 've read about performance problems when switching rendering targets too frequently , and other problems , which is the main reason i 'm xxunk to implement this . xxmaj but so far i could n't think of or find a better method . xxmaj although i think it should n't make a difference , for the moment i only care about xxup 2d ( mentioned just in case ) . < / p >

  < p > xxmaj my reason for asking is that i have a xxup vb program that is supposed to extract the first couple of paragraphs of xxunk text from a document - it 's doing so by iterating through the xxmaj word . xxmaj paragraphs collection . i do n't want the results to include tables of contents or other fields , i only want stuff that a human being would recognize as a header , title or a normal text paragraph . xxmaj however it turns out that if there 's a table of contents , then not only the table of contents itself but xxup every line in the table of contents appears as a separate item in xxmaj word . xxmaj paragraphs . i do n't want these but have n't been able to find any property on the xxmaj paragraph object that would allow me to distinguish and so ignore them ( i 'm guessing i need the solution to apply to other field types too , like table of figures and table of authorities , which i have n't yet actually encountered but i guess potentially would cause the same problem ) < / p >

  < p > i suppose i could implement a base class for xxmaj views to inherit from . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj however , it strikes me that perhaps this is a code smell to be using the xxmaj messenger in the xxmaj view ... it works , but it might not be the best way . i 'm wondering if i should instead create a property on the viewmodel and bind whatever part of the xxmaj view 's elements to it . xxmaj in the example of hiding a form , a property could be a boolean called "" xxmaj show "" . xxmaj as i think about it , i can see that in many cases this will result in having to write a valueconverter . xxmaj one way seems less xxunk . xxmaj the other way seems to require much more code and perhaps the introduction of xxunk xxunk , which could become a code smell in themselves . < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj so ( after all that build up ) my question is this : < / p > 
 
  < p > xxmaj is it preferable to use messages within the xxmaj view or is it better to add properties ( and potentially xxunk ) to allow the viewmodel to drive it in a more bindable fashion ? < / p >

  summary : summary , 
  text : content , 
  token : xxunk 
  } , 
  datatype : ' json ' , 
  type : ' xxup post ' , 
  success : function(data ) { 
  if ( data xxrep 4 & xxunk xxrep 4 & xxunk = = ' xxmaj success ' ) { 
  xxunk ( ) ; 
  } else if ( data xxrep 4 & xxunk ) { 
  alert('error : xxup api returned error code "" ' + xxunk + ' "" : ' + xxunk ) ; 
  } else { 
  alert('error : xxmaj unknown result from xxup api . ' ) ;
